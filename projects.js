            'Within the company’s extensive product portfolio, a lack of design cohesion was evident. The reasons for this were many - a major one being that the company was the result of a merger between two companies. There was a lot of overlap between products, but given the often complex nature of applications within the retail landscape, eliminating overlap and streamlining cannot be easily done. Especially since products are key in existing customer relationships. During the years, both companies had also acquired competitors, leading to even more product overlap and inconsistency - both in terms of aesthetics, and technical frameworks used. On top of this, there was a tendency for siloed work culture between product teams which didn’t help counteract the diversity.',
            'I was working as a front-end developer when I learned that someone, somewhere at the company, had engaged an external agency to deliver a design system. I knew I wanted to be involved, and I soon got permission to split my time 50/50 between coding and design system work. This marked the start of me transitioning into a design role again.']

          'The agency had got three products to focus on, which made sense for keeping the commission scope down. It was clear to me that part of what they were doing was a visual facelift for these products. But when I listened to my own organization we kept referring to the delivery as a ‘design system’, and a more or less all-inclusive one. But if you’re expecting a design system from looking at three products, there was a risk that we didn’t cover our needs properly.',
          'In general, the output reminded me more of a traditional set of graphic guidelines, and not a design system (that should sit in the intersection between design and code). This was noticeable through the absence of interaction states in components, poor accessibility in design choices, and a set of icons that left a lot to wish for in terms of quality and visual consistency.',
          'Aesthetically, the design system felt outdated. Now, visual style wasn’t the most crucial aspect of the project in my opinion (if you get the system in place that can always be updated later!), but I kept it in the back of my head.'
